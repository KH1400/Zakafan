# **App Name**: Fourfold Portal

## Core Features:

- Banner Display: Displays four vertical banners on the landing page.
- Hover Expansion: Each banner expands on hover, while compressing the others, creating a sliding panel effect.
- Page Linking: Each banner links to a separate dedicated page on the website.
- Fixed Layout: The landing page does not scroll; the entire layout is contained within the viewport.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4287f5) reminiscent of the uploaded image, conveying trustworthiness and forward motion, contrasting effectively in both light and dark modes, and avoiding overused associations with money (green) or alarm (red).
- Background color: Dark grey (#222) for a dark theme, providing a backdrop for the primary and accent colors to pop.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFDA63) similar to the logo, chosen to complement the blue and provide highlights, potentially with a neon or glowing effect.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern, and readable design. This font will be used for both headlines and body text.
- Ensure each panel in each state (compressed, expanded) has an ideal text/image ratio, providing enough but not overwhelming information.
- Use subtle, smooth transitions for the hover and panel expansion effects. Consider adding a slight bloom or glow effect during the transitions.
- Consider adding simple icons on each banner. Keep icons universal to help communicate across cultures. Ensure icons have a neon, outlined style.
